**glaciate:** made a few more changes, I think I'm satisfied with the state of the site right now. Things are snappier than ever, everything is clean and pleasing to look at. Following from [last time](/blog/post/weekly-roundup-spring-cleaning), further changes include the removal of the web font (now only using a local font) further reducing bandwidth, more text size and line height tweaks to maximise readability and a general consistency cleanup on links, colour usage, etc. I also got around to redoing the archive page and fixing some issues with server behaviour, page titling and metadata (still need to add page descriptions, though!), a lot was fixed thanks to [this nice little tool](http://nibbler.silktide.com/en/reports/glaciate.net).

**animé:** Persona 5 the Animation finished on Saturday, and it, uh, ended in a way. Of course, given a certain two things happened, it's not the ending it's trying to present it to be...For all of the faults with animation quality and pacing, the animé did a certain character _much_ better than the game. I hope to talk more about them shortly! 

**streaming:** I actually streamed today. Did you all know that the PS Vita had the ability to act as video output? Kinda rendered my reason for getting a PSTV moot. 

**gamedev:** yeah, yeah, PhotoVs blog post is still incoming, just trying to collect as much screenshots as I can.

**life:** okay I named this "Time" and gave a weebish video for a reason: I've come to find since getting a job that I have _no time for anything_ at all, when I do get home, I'm so tired that I'd be fine just lying down and falling asleep. I have no clue how people have the energy to be so...active...all day, just looking at them is exhausting. Oh well, I'll figure it out eventually.
