## Web Chat Aide *(2018)*
**Web Chat Aide** was my university dissertation project. It was an API created with JavaScript and C# which utilised *natural language processing* and *machine learning* to detect the presence of offensive speech in online discource. I created a dataset consisting of positive and negative sources subreddits, and trained it utilising a subset. **It had an 80% accuracy with the test dataset, and a 70% accuracy during a live demonstration of 20 different strings.** [More information](https://cds2018.computing.dundee.ac.uk/index.php/portfolio/carim-akeju/).

## Resolve *(2018 - Ongoing)*
**Resolve** is an engine-agnostic collision detection and resolution library made with C# for 2D games. I made it for use with the games that I usually make with MonoGame largely because I find writing collision resolution code to be a huge pain. I am using it with my current project PhotoVs. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CarimA/Resolve).

## Lofi Island *(2017 - 2018)*
**Lofi Island** was a multiplayer online game in which 8 players are assigned an island to live on and can do anything within the limited sandbox. Think Animal Crossing. I had been working on it on-off for a while and used it as part of university course which prompted me to [write about it a few times](https://glaciate.net/article/game-assignment-elevator-pitch/). Development is currently on hold, I'd like to resume it after finishing PhotoVs.
