So, on the off chance that you've been looking around recently, you'll notice that I haven't been neglecting the site in my own way: I've been doing a lot of rewrites and redesigns without actually writing any posts, but that's beside the point. It's even to the point that I've now rewritten the whole thing and [open sourced the site!](https://github.com/CarimA/glaciate.net)

In the transition, I've axed tagging and authors (tags may return at a later point depending on how I feel about their absence) and completely changed how the blog works: before, it was just your typical express Node site, now it just outright generates all of the web pages at runtime and serves them. Now Heroku might stop complaining about my memory usage!

In terms of me, not too much has changed. I'm still working on a game that I've yet to show off (although I have a first milestone coming up soon, so hopefully I might finally get to!)

I'm also still really busy and a bit too lazy in my downtime, choosing to catch up on sleep instead of doing even more programming at home. Same old same old. I actually do have a number of things I'd like to write about shortly, so expect that.
