spoiler: Uhhh hi. Yeah I didn't forget the site existed, I just got stuck in this spiral of "too little time to make a substantial update" -> "as time passes I need to make a more substantial update" so screw it, I'm just posting anyway.

**glaciate:** I made some style changes just to freshen things up. Looking at heroku, I can see that there's still actually a notable number of visits. How many of those are bots now, I've yet to figure out. Ohyeah, I finally set up SSL too: use HTTPS people! I've also taken the time to mirror all of the images on the server and compress them, images are (on average) 60% smaller in filesize!

**life:** I graduated! Not only that, but I found a job within a month; I'm now working as a Software Testing Engineer.

**gamedev:** In the interrim, I've made a decent amount of progress on a little project...more to come on that in another post very shortly.

**gaming:** Currently waiting on a PlayStation Vita that I've imported from Japan. When it arrives, I'll finally get to play Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable properly! Looking for other PS Vita/PSP suggestions too!

**streaming?:** sooooo I've decided that streaming regularly isn't really for me, but that's not to say I won't stream ever again. Just when I feel like it. Which ain't often. :)

Hm. Not really much more I want to cover, I'm more excited to write the next upcoming posts...
